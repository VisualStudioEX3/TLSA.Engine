# TLSA.Engine
#### XNA game engine designed and used for develop Grey Infrection XBLIG game.

##### Development date/period: 
* 2010 - 2011

##### History:
For years, I studied how develop mi own 2D game engine for general game developments. The first versions of this engine has been developed in Visual Basic 6.0 and Visual Basic .NET languages, using the dx_lib32 project as base.

In 2010, I joined with a friend for develop a game for the XBox Live Indie Games for XBox360, Grey Infection. For the game, I decided reused major parts of the last TLSA Engine coded in Visual Basic 6.0 and reprogrammed entirely in C# with XNA 4.0.

This is the current version of the engine used for develop Grey Infection. After Grey Infection, the engine has been updated with some fixes and optimizations, learned from the development of the XBox360 game, and new additions. In early 2012 I trying to extend the engine for support the Windows Phone 7 game development, but this version is unfinished and abandoned. 

P.D.: The last updates and Windows Phone 7 code not included in this repository, only the XBox360 version used in Grey Infection.
